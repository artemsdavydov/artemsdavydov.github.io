## Hi!

![me](./assets/img/profile_picture.jpg)

I am Artem Davydov, a 4th year Astronomy student at UBC and a summer (2021) research fellow at the Canadian Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics. My research project explores the application of the ROHSA toolkit developed by Dr. Anotine Marchal to rotation measure data. The project arose when Dr. Cameron Van Eck noticed a similarity in the data structure of hyperspecral line data and rotation measure data. I previosuly worked on a polarimetry data simulator for the upcoming Canadian Galactic Emission Mapper (CGEM) Telescope.
