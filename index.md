## Hi!

![me](./assets/img/profile_picture.jpg)

I am 4th year astronomy student at UBC. My research interests are in Cosmology and Galactic magentism. I worked on a polarimetry data simulator for the upcoming Canadian Galactic Emission Mapper (CGEM). I am currently a research fellow at the Canadian Institue of Theoretical Astrophysics. I am researching the application of hyperspectral line tools (ROHSA) to Rotation Measure data.
